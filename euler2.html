	<h5>Project Euler - Problem #2</h5>

	<p>"Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."</p>

  <script>
		// determine if number is even
		const isEvenNumber = (n) => {
			return n % 2 == 0;
		}

		const fibEvenSum = (max) => {
			let current = 1;
			let sum = 0;
			let next = 2;
			while (current < max) {
				const temp = current + next;
				if (isEvenNumber(current)) sum += current;
				if (isEvenNumber(next)) sum += next;
				if (isEvenNumber(temp)) sum += temp;
				current = next + temp;
				next = temp + current;
			}
			return sum;
